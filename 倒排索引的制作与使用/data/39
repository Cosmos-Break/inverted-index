It is in the [[species]] ''Malus domestica'' in the [[rose]] family [[Rosaceae]]. The apple is one of the most [[tillage|grown]] tree fruits. It is grown in orchards. The apple tree came from [[Central Asia]]. Its wild ancestor is still there today. There are more than 7 493 kinds of different apple trees.<ref name=England/> At least 55 million [[ton]]s of apples were grown around in the world in 2005. All together, they cost about $10 billion. [[People's Republic of China|China]] produced about 35% of the world's apples.<ref name="Apple"/> The [[United States]] produces more than 7.5% of the apples around the world. This makes it the second greatest producer. [[Iran]] is third, after which comes [[Turkey]], [[Russia]], [[Italy]] and [[India]]. == Botanical information == The apple has a small, leaf-shedding tree that grows up to 3 to 12&nbsp;metres (9.8 to 39&nbsp;ft) tall. The apple tree has a broad crown with thick [[twig]]s. The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[Phyllotaxis|alternately arranged]] simple [[oval]]s. They are 5 to 12&nbsp;[[centimeter|centimetres]] long and 3–6&nbsp;centimetres (1.2–2.4&nbsp;in) wide. It has a sharp top with a soft underside. [[Blossom]]s come out in [[spring]] at the same time that the leaves begin to bud. The [[flower]]s are white. They also have a slightly pink color. They are five [[petal]]ed, and 2.5 to 3.5&nbsp;centimetres (0.98 to 1.4&nbsp;in) in [[wikt:diameter|diameter]]. The fruit [[wikt:maturity|matures]] in [[autumn]]. It is usually 5 to 9&nbsp;centimetres (2.0 to 3.5&nbsp;in) in diameter. There are five [[carpel]]s arranged in a [[star]] in the middle of the fruit. Every carpel has one to three [[seed]]s.

It is said that [[Alexander the Great]] discovered [[wikt:small|dwarfed]] apples in [[Asia Minor]] in 300 [[BCE]]. [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] have used winter apples as an important food for thousands of years. From when [[Europe]]ans arrived, [[Argentina]] and the [[United States]] have used apples as food as well.<ref name=app6>{{cite web |url= http://www.vegparadise.com/highestperch39.html |title= An apple a day keeps the doctor away |accessdate= 27 January 2008 |publisher=vegparadise.com }}</ref> Apples were brought to [[North America]] in the 1600s. The first apple [[orchard]] on the North American continent was said to be near [[Boston]] in 1625. In the 1900s, costly fruit [[industry|industries]], where the apple was a very important species, began developing.<ref name=app3/> == In culture == === Germanic paganism === [[Image:Carl Larsson Brita as Iduna.jpg|thumb|"Brita as [[Iðunn|Iduna]]" (1901) by Carl Larsson]] In [[Norse mythology]], the goddess [[Iðunn]] gives apples to the gods in ''Prose Edda'' (written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) that makes them young forever. English [[wikt:scholar|scholar]] H. R. Ellis Davidson suggests that apples were related to [[religion|religious]] practices in [[Germanic paganism]]. It was from there, she claims, that [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were discovered in the place of burial for the Oseberg [[ship]] in [[Norway]]. She also remarks that fruit and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] (Iðunn having been described as changing into a nut in ''Skáldskaparmál'') have been discovered in the early [[grave]]s of the [[Germanic peoples]] in [[England]]. They have also been discovered somewhere else on the continent of Europe. She suggests that this may have had a [[symbol]]ic meaning. Nuts are still a symbol of [[fertility]] in Southwest England. Sometimes apples are eaten after they are [[cooked]]. Often apples are eaten uncooked. Apples can also be made into [[drink]]s. [[Apple juice]] and apple [[cider]] are apple drinks. The flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet. Apples used for cooking are sour, and need to be cooked with sugar, while other apples are sweet, and do not need cooking. There are some seeds at the core, that can be removed with a [[tool]] that removes the core, or by carefully using a [[knife]]. The [[scientific name]] of the apple tree genus in the [[Latin]] language is ''Malus''. Most apples that people grow are of the ''Malus domestica'' species. Most apples are good to eat [[raw]] (not cooked), and are also used in many kinds of [[bake]]d foods, such as [[apple pie]]. Apples are cooked until they are [[wikt:soft|soft]] to make [[apple sauce]]. Apples are also made into the [[drink]]s [[apple juice]] and [[cider]]. Usually, cider contains a little [[alcohol]], about as much as [[beer]]. The regions of [[Brittany]] in [[France]] and [[Cornwall]] in [[England]] are known for their apple ciders. If one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type. The seed will have [[DNA]] from the apple that the seeds came from, but it will also have DNA from the apple flower that [[pollinate]]d the seeds, which may well be a different type. This means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two. In order to grow a certain type of apple, a small twig, or 'scion', is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired, and then added on to a specially grown [[stump]] called a rootstock. The tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed. == Apple cultivars == There are more than 7,500 known [[cultivar]]s of apples.<ref name="Elzebroek">{{cite book|last=Elzebroek|first=A.T.G.|coauthors=Wind, K.|title=Guide to Cultivated Plants|publisher=CAB International|location=Wallingford|date=2008|page=27|isbn=1845933567|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YvU1XnUVxFQC&lpg=PT39&dq=apple%20cultivars%207%2C500&pg=PT39#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref> Different cultivars are available for [[temperate]] and [[subtropical]] climates.

Most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh (dessert apples). However, some are grown simply for cooking or making [[cider]]. Cider apples are usually too [[wikt:tart|tart]] to eat immediately. However, they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.<ref name="apples1">{{cite web |url= http://casfs.ucsc.edu/publications/news%20and%20notes/Fall_06_N&N.pdf |title= Autumn Apple Musings |accessdate= 24 January 2008 |format= pdf |pages= 1–2 |author=Sue Tarjan |publisher=News & Notes of the UCSC Farm & Garden, Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems |date=fall 2006 }}</ref> Most popular apple cultivars are soft but [[wikt:crisp|crisp]].

This is because popular tastes in apples have become different. Most [[North America]]ns and [[Europe]]ans enjoy sweet apples.<ref name=World/> Extremely sweet apples with hardly any acid taste are popular in [[Asia]]<ref name=World>{{cite web |url= http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp2/circular/1998/98-03/applefea.html |title= World apple situation |accessdate= 24 January 2008 }}</ref> and India.<ref name=apples1/> == In the United Kingdom == In the [[United Kingdom]] there are about 3000 different types of apples. The most common apple type grown in England is the 'Bramley seedling', which is a popular cooking apple. Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early 1900s, when apples were rarely brought in from other countries. Organizations such as [http://www.commonground.org.uk/ Common Ground] teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit. '[[Apple Day]]' is celebrated each [[October 21]] in many countries. == In North America == Many apples are grown in [[temperate]] parts of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In many areas where apple growing is important, people have huge celebrations: * [[Annapolis Valley Apple Blossom Festival]] - held five days every spring (May-June) in [[Nova Scotia]] * [[Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival]] - held six days every spring in [[Winchester, Virginia]]. * [[Washington State Apple Blossom Festival]] - held two weeks every spring (April-May) in [[Wenatchee, Washington]] == Varieties of apples == [[File:Golden delicious apple.jpg|right|thumb|A Golden Delicious apple.]] There are lots of different varieties of apples, including: * [[Fuji (apple)]] * [[Gala]] * [[Golden Delicious]] (some times called a Green Delicious Apple) * [[Granny Smith]] * [[Jonagold]] * [[McIntosh]] * [[Pink Lady]] * [[Red Delicious]] * [[Winesap]] * [[Cox's Orange Pippin]] == Family == Apples are in the group [[Maloideae]]. It is a subfamily of the family ''[[Rosaceae]]''. They are in the same subfamily as [[pear]]s. Its family is the family of rose like plants, and roses are in the family. ==References== {{reflist|colwidth=30em|refs= <ref name=Potter>Potter, D.; Eriksson, T.; Evans, R.C.; Oh, S.H.; Smedmark, J.E.E.; Morgan, D.R.; Kerr, M.; Robertson, K.R.; Arsenault, M.P.; Dickinson, T.A.; Campbell, C.S.
