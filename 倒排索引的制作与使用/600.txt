It was founded on 1 October 1949. It has over 1.3 billion [[people]], which is more than any other country in the [[world]].<ref name="Census2010" /> It covers an area of 9.6 million [[square kilometers]]. The capital city is [[Beijing]], and [[Shanghai]] is the city with the most people living in it. The [[United Kingdom]] gave [[Hong Kong]] back to China in 1997 and [[Portugal]] gave [[Macao]] back to China in 1999. These two cities remain highly autonomous. The central government is responsible for defense and foreign affairs but not the daily operations for 50 years. PRC claims [[Taiwan]] as one of its many provinces. However, PRC does not have control of [[Taiwan]] which has an entirely different [[political]] system and officially known as the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan)]]. == History == {{see also|History of China}} <!-- since we don't have a History of the PRC article--> [[File:China, Mao (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mao Zedong]] founding the People's Republic of China in 1949]] In 1912, the [[Qing Dynasty]] was overthrown by the [[Kuomintang]], a [[nationalist]] party, and the [[Republic of China]] established. Over time, [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideas grew popular and the [[Communist Party of China|Communist party]] was formed. In 1927, the [[Chinese Civil War]] began as the Kuomintang, led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and the Communists fought one another. By 1949, the [[Red Army]] of the Chinese Communist Party had gained control over [[mainland China]] and [[Mao Zedong]] announced the creation of the People's Republic of China. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the other nationalists fled to [[Taiwan]]. As the leader of the People's Republic of China, Mao began many social and economic reform projects with mixed results. The [[Great Leap Forward]], from 1958 to 1961, tried to [[industrialization|industrialize]] China and increase its food production, but resulted in one of the largest [[famine]]s in history. It is estimated that 45 million people died as a result of this reform project.<ref name="Akbar2010">{{Cite news|url =http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html |title= Mao's Great Leap Forward 'killed 45 million in four years'|accessdate=26 March 2013 |work=The Independent |location=London |first=Arifa|last=Akbar|date=17 September 2010}}</ref> In 1966, Mao began the [[Cultural Revolution]] to remove [[capitalism|capitalist]] influences from society and government. Major government officials and ordinary citizens were accused of being "revisionists" - people who disagreed with some parts of Marxism - or "counter-revolutionaries" and were [[persecution|persecuted]]. Many universities and schools were closed, and historical and religious sites were destroyed. Although the program officially ended in 1969, it continued until Mao's death in 1976. During this time period, the People's Republic of China did not get along with the [[capitalist]] countries of the [[Western world]]. Beginning in the 1960s, relationships between the People's Republic of China and the [[Soviet Union]] also became increasingly unfriendly in the [[Sino-Soviet Split]]. In 1972, to counter the power of the Soviet Union, Mao and [[Zhou Enlai]] met with US President [[Richard Nixon]] in Beijing. This began to improve relationships between China and the Western world. After Mao's death, there was a power struggle between the [[Gang of Four]] and [[Hua Guofeng]], the man Mao had chosen to be the next leader of China. Eventually, [[Deng Xiaoping]], one of the [[veteran]]s of the revolution, took power. He began a "Reform and Opening Up" ({{zh|s=改革开放|t=改革開放}}) campaign. These reforms tried to make the People's Republic of China a modern, industrial - but still socialist - nation by moving towards a [[market economy|market system]]. Deng's policies would be known as "socialism with Chinese characteristics." Although Deng's policy helped loosen restrictions on citizens, the People's Republic of China continues to have problems with the amount of control the government has over citizens' private lives. In 1979, the [[one-child policy]], which limits most couples to one child, was created because of the [[overpopulation]] problem in the People's Republic of China. This policy is highly [[controversy|controversial]] and many Westerners have criticized it. News and Internet sites are also [[censorship|censored]] by the government. In 1989, the Chinese government used soldiers and tanks to stop a [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square]] organized by students seeking political reform. This action received worldwide criticism and led to [[economic sanction]]s being placed on the Chinese government. In [[August]] 2008, China hosted the [[Summer Olympics]] for the first time. == Geography == {{see also|List of cities in the People's Republic of China}} The People's Republic of China is the third-largest country in the world by land area after [[Russia]] and [[Canada]]. China borders 14 nations. It borders [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[Burma]] in Southeast Asia; India, [[Bhutan]], Nepal and [[Pakistan]]<ref name="Ref_at">China's border with Pakistan falls in the disputed [[Kashmir]] province. The area under Pakistani-administration is claimed by India.</ref> in South Asia; [[Afghanistan]], Tajikistan, [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] in Central Asia; a small section of [[Altai Republic|Russian Altai]] and [[Mongolia]] in [[Inner Asia]]; and the [[Russian Far East]] and [[North Korea]] in Northeast Asia. China has two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River]]. There is also the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]]. The world's highest point, [[Mt. Everest]] (8848m), is on the border. The country's lowest point, and the world's fourth-lowest, is the dried lake bed of [[Ayding Lake]] (−154m). === Biodiversity === [[File:Panda Cub from Wolong, Sichuan, China.JPG|thumb|left|A [[giant panda]] photographed in [[Sichuan]].]] China is one of 17 [[megadiverse countries]].<ref name="Ref_2009a">{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/theme-reports/biodiversity/biodiversity01-3.html |title=Biodiversity Theme Report |publisher=Environment.gov.au |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> It is in two of the world's major [[ecozone]]s: the [[Palearctic]] and the [[Indomalaya]]. In the Palearctic zone, mammals such as the horse, [[camel]], [[tapir]], and [[jerboa]] can be found. Among the species in the Indomalaya region are the [[Leopard Cat]], [[bamboo rat]], [[treeshrew]], and various [[monkey]] and [[ape]] species. Some overlap is between the two regions; [[deer]], [[antelope]], bears, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], pigs, and many rodent species can all be found in China's environments. The famous [[giant panda]] is found only in a limited area along the Yangtze River. China has a continuing problem with trade in [[endanger]]ed species. There are now laws to stop such activities. China also has a variety of forest types. Cold [[coniferous]] forests cover most of the north of the country. The forest have animal species such as [[moose]] and the [[Asian black bear]], along with over 120 bird species. Moist [[conifer]] forests can have thickets of [[bamboo]]. It is replaced by [[rhododendron]]s in higher montane stands of [[juniper]] and [[taxus|yew]]. [[Subtropical]] forests, which are mostly in central and southern China. These support as many as 146,000 species of flora. Tropical and seasonal [[rainforest]]s, though confined to [[Yunnan]] and [[Hainan Island]], have a quarter of all the plant and animal species found in China. == Military == The PRC Armed Forces is one of the most powerful Army in the world. Nowadays PRC is among the atomic powers in the world. It also has the largest army in the world. == People and culture == There are 56 recognized minority [[ethnic group|ethnic minority groups]] in [[China]]. [[Han]] is the largest ethnic group in China (92% of the population). The [[Communist Party of China]] controls the government. [[Mandarin Chinese]] is the main spoken language. == Transport == [[Train|Trains]] are commonly used for moving from one place to another, mainly for long distances. [[Bullet train|Bullet trains]] are faster and more common in the cities. China has more high-speed trains than any other country in the world. [[Bus|Buses]] and [[air travel|air transport]] are also very common. ==Related pages== * [[List of provinces of China]] * [[Political problems of China]] == Other websites == * {{en}} [http://www.china21th.net.ms/ Information, Links, History and more of China ] * {{en}} [http://www.china-map-guide.com/ China Maps] == References == {{reflist}} {{Asia}} [[Category:People's Republic of China| ]]
